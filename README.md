# Overview
This is a simple web scraper for tracking the prices of some of my favorite handheld consoles. Hopefully I can strike a sweet deal tracking these daily!

This program uses the Beautiful Soup library for python as well as requests for python. 

My purpose for writing this software was to understand how web scraping working and what it can be capable of.

# Development Environment

I used the PyCharm IDE to write this code as well as the beautiful soup library (as mentioned before). This also used the lxml library to parse the html that is being scraped from the web. This is all provided through large amount of support python gets for its development. 

# Useful Websites

I found these websites were able to cover most of my questions and initial set up of creating a web scraper.

# Future Work

- Able to save data in a csv file for later use
- Able to graph data for history checks on prices
- More handhelds and consoles added to scraping
